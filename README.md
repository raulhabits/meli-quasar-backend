**Quasar Backend**

Far far away in a remote galaxy the Rebel Alliance tried to establish communications with the Jedi Order, because they needed supplies and help. Given that they are under Palpatine's battlecruisers attack the message should be delivered and effective. 

The Jedi Order guided by the force discovered this Golang Service which let them recover the message and find the coordinates of the signal.

For using this Golang service you should have installed at least the **go1.15.7** of Golang version, and in local environment it wil be executed success with the command **go run main.go** in the main source of the project


**Notes.** 
1. This service has some differences regarding the original specifications, because the developer tried to gain a better precision using **float64** datatypes instead of **float32** suggested in the exercice.
2. The developer used the library github.com/MindorksOpenSource/gogeom for working with geometries, because the problem was reduced to a point which intercepts all the circles could be drawn using the satellite position, and the distance provided. 

**Enjoy your day**

And make the force be with you.
